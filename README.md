# FT PRINTF

## Overview
**`ft_printf`** is a project from the 42 curriculum that requires you to recode the `printf()` function from libc. The goal is to implement a simplified version of the original `printf()` with the specified conversion specifiers. This project aims to deepen your understanding of variadic functions in C.

## Features
- Implements a subset of the `printf()` function from libc.
- Handles the specified conversion specifiers: `c`, `s`, `p`, `d`, `i`, `u`, `x`, `X`, `%`.
- Does not implement the buffer management of the original `printf()`.

## Usage

To use `ft_printf` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/aelmaar/ft_printf.git
```
2. Include the ft_printf.h header file in your project.
3. Compile the ft_printf source files using `make`
4. Link your project with the library
